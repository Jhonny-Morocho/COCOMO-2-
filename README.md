# COCOMO II (Constructive Cost Model) in Web (Using HTML+CSS+JS)
Reading lines of source code and calculating software metrics
Software Engineering II Project

The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is a procedural software cost estimation model developed by Barry W. Boehm. The model parameters are derived from fitting a regression formula using data from historical projects. It is a tool based on the lines of code which makes it very powerful for estimating costs and not like others that only measure effort based on size. It represents the most extensive empirical model for software estimation.

## Lines of code as a measure of software size

The number of lines of code or LOC (Lines of Code in English) are a standard metric that is used to determine the size of a computer development and also to some extent give an idea of the effort that has been needed to create it.

LOCs are a somewhat imprecise measure, because you can write more or less compact code according to the style of each one, there are languages with syntax that are more "talkative" than others and therefore generate more lines, and the style guides themselves and Each company's rules may vary.

However, the LOC metric and its related ones give us a very good idea of the size of a software development and it can be interesting for many things.

Description
------------

This software made with web technologies (HTML + CSS + JS) reads the lines of code from a file (php, java, nodejs) discarding comments and empty lines, and based on that calculates the corresponding metrics of COCOMO II:

+ Estimate of Effort
+ Development time
+ Number of people who have worked on the project
+ Productivity
+ Project Cost

The types of projects you read can be:

+ Organic
+ Semi-coated
+ Embedded

In addition, use the definition checklist for source statements counts

The program follows the line of the three COCOMO models:

+ Application composition model.
+ Pre-design phase model
+ Post-architecture phase model
